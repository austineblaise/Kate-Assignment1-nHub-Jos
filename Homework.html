    <div id="about"><p>NHub is a place where gold is refined into pure gold, where family tides
        are truly expressed, where low IQ's are upgraded into high ones, 
        where hope is given to a generation who's hope is almost dashed.
        A place that techies  becomes better developers and thinkers. Above all, 
        teaching the tenets of team work which has made us achieve so much this year.</p>
        <p>Nhub is a place where already closed minds about technology are reopen again. 
        I really appreciate and feel thankful finding myself in such a place, it has made me get myself back. 
        NHub has helped me revive the pleasure i find in coding once again. I see it as my new home, 
        the hub has helped in bringing people together to share ideas, to learn work as a team, as one big family. 
        With great efforts no one would regret ever been there and i truly hope to be there a bit longer because there are lots to achieve.
        When you intend not thinking high and hard, you find yourself doing so because you wouldn't want to be left behind especially when you come across the well trained developers,
        it feels more of like a challenge that you will just have to push harder to get to the top too but Nhub will not just see you get to the top but getting to the top with positive skills and talent. 
        yes, Nhub it is any day,  anytime, a place to be well groomed into becoming a world class developer.
        The hub shall keep growing higher and higher by the grace of God.</p>
